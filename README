Overview

Add a symlink in /etc/smrsh pointing <sender> to /usr/local/sbin/recmail
e.g
	
	# cd /etc/smrsh
	# ln -s /usr/local/sbin/recmail globocom

Add an entry for the sender to /etc/mail/virtusertable pointing to an alias 
for which you put an alias in /etc/aliases.

In /etc/mail/virtusertable add an entry

	globocom@pccl.info	globocom

Running make after making that change.

Then in /etc/aliases add an entry

	globocom:	|/etc/smrsh/globocom

Running newaliases after making that change.


Whenever email is sent to that address, it is piped through recmail

recmail will look at argv[0] to see who it has been called as (stripping off
the pathname). It will use this to determine where to store the data.

It will split the message up into its parts and store them under 
/data/maildata/<sender>/YYYY/MM/DD/part-xxx.obj along with the orginal
email stored under /data/maildata/<sender>/YYYY/MM/DD/UUID/maildata.dat

There is also an index file created (00INDEX) that links original attachment 
filenames to their part-xxx.obj counterparts.

Multiple messages sent in the same day will be stored under separate UUID/ 
directories. Where UUID is e.g 33faa523-d10f-4162-9876-ba30476a155c.


You can run recmail manually e.g

	./recmail /path/to/somedir < mailfile

Where /path/to/somedir is instead of /data/maildata and mailfile is a full
email message.
